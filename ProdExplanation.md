# Production Deployment Overview

This document explains how the Notification System is designed to run in production, including the key components, deployment strategies, and missing processing logic for provider integration.

## 1. Containerization & Orchestration

- **Docker Images:**  
  Each component—the notification orchestrator and the three dedicated worker microservices (Email, SMS, and Slack)—is built as a Docker image using multi-stage builds.

- **Orchestration Platforms:**  
  In production, these images are deployed using an orchestration tool (such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm) to enable auto-scaling, rolling updates, and robust service discovery.

## 2. Messaging Infrastructure

- **Kafka Cluster:**  
  A production-grade Kafka cluster is deployed with multiple brokers, replication, and partitioning. This setup provides high throughput, fault tolerance, and availability.

- **Topic Organization:**  
  Each notification channel has its own Kafka topic (e.g., `email-worker`, `sms-worker`, `slack-worker`), decoupling processing and allowing each worker service to scale independently.

## 3. Service Scalability & Reliability

- **Notification Orchestrator:**  
  - Exposes a stateless HTTP API to accept notification requests.  
  - Validates and publishes messages to Kafka topics based on the target channel.  
  - Can be scaled horizontally behind a load balancer.

- **Worker Microservices:**  
  - Three separate worker microservices (Email, SMS, Slack) subscribe to their respective Kafka topics.  
  - Each worker processes messages with built-in retry logic (using exponential backoff) and DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) handling for messages that exceed maximum retry attempts.  
  - Each worker service can be scaled independently based on load.

## 4. Provider Integration & Processing Logic

- **Implemented Worker Microservices:**  
  All three worker microservices—Email, SMS, and Slack—are implemented using similar logic. They subscribe to their respective Kafka topics (e.g., `email-worker`, `sms-worker`, `slack-worker`) and include common retry, exponential backoff, and DLQ handling.

- **Missing Processing Logic:**  
  While the base worker functionality is fully implemented across all three channels, the actual processing logic to send notifications to the external providers is not yet in place:
  - **Email:** The email worker simulates processing but does not integrate with an SMTP server or email API.
  - **SMS:** The SMS worker simulates processing, but the code to call an SMS provider (such as Twilio or another SMS API) is missing.
  - **Slack:** The Slack worker simulates processing, however, the logic to call Slack’s API to post messages is not implemented.

- **Future Enhancements:**  
  - **Develop a Provider Adapter Layer:** Introduce an abstraction (e.g., a `Sender` interface) that defines the method(s) for sending notifications.  
  - **Integrate Provider APIs:** Implement provider-specific adapters for Email, SMS, and Slack, making the necessary API calls or SMTP interactions.  
  - **Enhanced Error Handling & Monitoring:** Refine error handling for provider interactions and add metrics to monitor these external API calls.

## 5. User Notification Preferences Database
  A dedicated database layer is used to store user settings—such as opt-in/opt-out status per notification channel—ensuring that notifications are only sent to users who have consented.

- **Schema**
  Create a table named notification_preferences with the following columns:
  - **user_id (string)**: Unique identifier for the user.
  - **channel (string)**: Notification channel (e.g., "email", "sms", "slack").
  - **opt_in (boolean)**: Indicates whether the user has opted in for notifications on the specified channel.
  - **updated_at (timestamp)**: Records the time of the most recent update to the user's preference.
  - **created_at (timestamp)**: Records the time of creation of the user's preference.

  A sample SQL schema might look like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE notification_preferences (
    user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    channel VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    opt_in BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, channel)
);
```

- **Go-Migrations**
Utilize a migrations tool (e.g., golang-migrate) to manage schema evolution. Migration scripts ensure that the creation and modification of the notification_preferences table are versioned and reproducible, facilitating smooth updates and rollbacks.

- **Integration**
The notification orchestrator will integrate with this database layer as follows:

- **Pre-Send Check:**
Before sending a notification, the orchestrator queries the notification_preferences table to confirm that the user has opted in for notifications on the target channel.

- **Decision Logic:**
If the user has not opted in, the notification is skipped, ensuring that notifications are only sent to consenting users.

- **Configuration:**
Database connection parameters (e.g., host, port, credentials) and migration scripts are managed as part of the system’s configuration, enabling seamless updates and maintenance.

This design ensures that notifications are delivered only to users who have explicitly consented, enhancing user experience and compliance with user preferences.

## 6. Data Retention & Message Serialization
  To further strengthen the design, configure retention policies for both Kafka and the user preferences database:

- **Kafka:**
  - **Retention**: Define retention periods for topics to control disk usage and ensure stale messages are purged.
  - **Compaction**: Consider enabling Kafka compaction for topics where only the latest state per key is required. This reduces storage overhead by retaining only the most recent      message for each key.
  - **Backup**: Implement backup strategies for critical topics so that message data can be restored in case of failures.
- **User Preferences Database:**
  - **Backup**: Implement regular backups and archive historical records as needed to preserve user settings and support recovery.
- **Message Compression & Serialization:**
  If the volume or size of message data is large, consider the following strategies
  
  - **Compression:**
    Enable compression on Kafka messages to reduce bandwidth usage and storage costs.
  - **Serialization Formats:**
    - Use efficient serialization formats such as Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) or Avro.
    - These formats provide compact encoding and a schema-based approach to manage message versions, ensuring backward and forward compatibility as the system evolves.
    
    By configuring retention policies, enabling Kafka compaction when needed, and using efficient message compression and serialization formats, the system can optimize resource usage, maintain data integrity, and ensure efficient communication between services.

## 7. Observability & Monitoring

- **Metrics Collection:**  
  Prometheus scrapes metrics from the orchestrator and each worker microservice (e.g., HTTP request durations, Kafka consumer/producer latencies, and channel-specific processing rates). Grafana dashboards visualize these metrics in real time.

- **Centralized Logging & Tracing:**  
  Logs are aggregated using a centralized logging solution (such as the ELK stack) and distributed tracing is implemented to monitor inter-service calls.

- **Health Checks:**  
  Each service exposes a `/health` endpoint for readiness and liveness probes, ensuring that orchestration tools can automatically monitor service health.

## 8. Security

- **Secure Communication:**  
  All inter-service communication is secured with TLS, including communication with Kafka and external provider APIs.

- **Access Control:**  
  Authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens) secure the HTTP API and provider endpoints.

- **Secrets Management:**  
  Tools like HashiCorp Vault are used to securely manage sensitive configurations (such as credentials and API keys).

## 9. Deployment Pipelines

- **CI/CD Pipelines:**  
  Automated pipelines (using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.) build, test, and deploy container images. This ensures consistent deployments and rapid rollouts of new features or bug fixes.

- **Deployment Strategies:**  
  Canary deployments or rolling updates are used to minimize downtime during releases.

## 10. Alerts for On-call Engineers

- **Threshold-based Alerts:**  
  Critical metrics (e.g., HTTP error rates, Kafka consumer lag, DLQ message rates, and processing latencies) are monitored in real time using Prometheus. Alerts are triggered when thresholds are exceeded, indicating potential issues with service health or performance.
    
- **Notification Channels:**  
  Alerts are sent via multiple channels (such as email, SMS, or a dedicated on-call management tool like PagerDuty) to ensure that on-call engineers are notified promptly.
    
- **Escalation Policies:**  
  Defined escalation policies ensure that alerts are automatically escalated if they are not acknowledged or resolved within a specified time window.
    
- **Runbooks:**  
  Detailed runbooks are provided with each alert to guide on-call engineers in diagnosing and resolving common issues quickly.
    
- **Regular Testing:**  
  Periodic simulated alerts (e.g., using tools like Chaos Monkey) verify that the alerting system functions as expected and that on-call engineers are familiar with the procedures.
